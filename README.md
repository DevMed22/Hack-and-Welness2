## Inspiration
Many people start their diet with a strong desire to reach the perfect body shape, but after a while, they feel alone on the road, and sadly their journey stops. We thought about this idea and created a website that uses AI to engage people and connect them to make the journey competitive and enjoyable.

## What it does
Allow fitness hackers to compete with each other through sharing their progress and ranking on the leaderboard by winning points for daily activities. AI helps our heroes to generate their diet plans based on their personal information.
Everyone can explore the popular ingredients with their nutrition values to customize their favorite meals. 

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for Frontend.
We used Python/Django to build the Backend.
We used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data analysis and visualization.
We used sklearn and dietkit to build our machine learning model. 
We used streamlit to build the frontend of the AI app.

## Challenges we ran into
We had some errors and made our search to solve them. 
The time was challenging although we began our project just 24 hours ago.
We face some problems dealing with GitHub repo to distribute work between us but with try and error we got our way.
We faced some problems in connecting the frontend to the backend as we are developing our Django app in a short time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have built this project in less than 24 hour from zero to hero.
Our AI model integrates well with the website and ready to be used by users.
We collaborated together in a professional way through using GitHub and Discord.
The pair programming was really great skill to practice and we enjoyed the process and proud of our progress.
## What we learned
We have sharpened our teamwork skills through distributing workload and managing our work using GitHub project boards.
Everyone has sharpened his technology and understanding of it within the context of a complete project through integration of different technologies.
Brainstorming our ideas together and respecting others opinions and suggestions so finally we vote for our best solution.
How to participate in MLH Hackathons as it is our first time.

## What's next for AI Diet Assistant
Hosting our website on a cloud platform (Microsoft Azure) and adding a domain.
Adding chatbot to the website and voice recognition to help users have best experience with our website.
Building an android app for our website so users can access take it with them everywhere.
